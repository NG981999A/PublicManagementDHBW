# Team Agreements

A team agreement (or a team contract) is **a written document detailing how a team agrees to work together**. Team agreements can describe procedures such as decision-making processes, how to get support, and the tools and communication methods that the team uses.

* ➡️ see also Working Agreement
* ➡️ good enough for now, safe enough to try?
* ➡️ Use [Protocol Check](https://liveingreatness.com/core-protocols/protocol-check/) when needed.

# Our Team Agreement Proposal (v1)

1. Constructive Feedback is always welcome, in all directions.
2. We are all experts and learners at the same time.
3. We are on time and we finish on time.
4. Help each other to learn and to feel welcome.
5. To learn is to actively participate.
6. When energy is low, call for an energizer!
7. Let's have fun learning and growing.

# Mental Models of the Week

* **Shu-Ha-Ri** - a Model that describes mastery paths
* **Circle of Influence** - there is more we can influence than we think we can
* **The Growth Mindset** - always stay open, there is no finish with learning
* **People/Process/Technology** - how it all fits together to make projects successful
* **All Models Are Wrong, Some Are Useful** - be aware that models are simplifications of reality
